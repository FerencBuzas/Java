Cross Origin
    The browsers had Cross Origin problems. When I added a Cross Origin extension Chrome,
      it had Authentication error.
    Then I added Cross Origin header to the service, following
      https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/.

Spring injection
  If an I/F has 2 implementations, one can be annotated as @Primary.

About the Angular app
Steps:

- Copied develop/tour-of-heroes/ go SheetMusicRegister/angular
-   checked the Heroes, committed
- created subdir hero, moved all heroes there
-   checked the Heroes, committed
- Copied hero/ to book/, to publisher/; renamed files;
    replaced HEROES with BOOKS,
    replaced HERO with BOOK,
    similarly: Heroes, Hero, heroes, hero.
-   checked the Heroes, committed
- There was now Hero only in app/ and in hero/;
    now renamed all hero to composer,
    renamed contents with the algorythm above.
- Added Book and Publisher to each place with Composer

The Web developer page is much better in Chrome than in FireFox.
Cross... error in Chrome: an extension is available.
Then: Not authorized
--> The solution: add @C

# install karma for test:
  from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-systemjs
npm install karma-systemjs systemjs es6-module-loader systemjs-plugin-babel

# To avoid testing error about like "Cannot load app.component.css":
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
    }).overrideComponent(AppComponent, {  // add this
        set: { styleUrls: [] }
    }).compileComponents();
    
  (It has also been solved in Angular-CLI).
